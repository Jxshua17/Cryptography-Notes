<h2>My Cryptography Notes from my final year</h2>

So this project started off initially in the [Grokking Algorithms](https://github.com/Jxshua17/Grokking-Algorithms) repo and now i have 
decided to move it to its own repo which i think is proper rather than jumbling it up together with the GA project.<br>
<br>
I think i might talked about why i was doing this in a commit message but i think it would be proper for it to be here.
So one of my favourite things is cryptography. it is a subject that i have been interested in since i was in ss2 or ss3 (around 2014) when 
i read Digital Fortress by Dan Brown. So when i saw Cryptography as an elective in my final year, i had no option than to take it and i only fell in 
love with it more. 
I remember being on my way to class with Da. and he was talking about his friend who was studying abroad having to implement all of these algorithms we were learning in their
own Cryptography class. I couldn't code at the level that i can now so it never just occurred to me to write programs for the encryption techniques i was learning.<br>
<br> 
I was studying Grokking Algorithms and  just writing code, and then it occurred to me to write methods/functions for what i learned a few years 
back. I fetched my notes and just got straight to work. <br><br>
This project contains encryption techniques that i learnt in that class.
